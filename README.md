# Food ordering application using Unity3D and Firebase realtime database

## Description:

The mobile app is developed mainly to test firebase with Unity3D. I used firebase realtime database to sync user data
and orders. Each user have a node in the realtime database with userID. The user node contains all information about the user
including past orders.

## Features:

* Registration and Login : Users can create accounts to personalize their exprience and access orders history.
* Restaurant selections: There are multiple restaurants to choose to order food from.
* Order history: Users can see information about thier past orders.

## Technologies Used:

* Unity3D: Used Unity's UI system along with TextMesh Pro package.
* Firebase RealTime Database: Sync data with realtime database insure data security and fast response.
